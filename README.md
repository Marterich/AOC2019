Advent of Code 2019

This is my take on the Advent of Code 2019 challenge :)

If there is a .txt file with the same name as the .py file, it is used as the source for the program to run.

I used Python 3.8 and i tried to import no unneccesary modules if i could accomplish the same thing without them
